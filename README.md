## **What is this language school all about!**

The **"Language Store"** website is a hub for language enthusiasts, connecting passionate language teachers with students eager to learn. It serves two primary purposes:

1. **Promoting Services:** Showcasing the expertise of our tutors and the variety of lessons offered, attracting new students to join.
2. **Supporting Current Students:** Providing a seamless platform for existing students to book lessons, explore new offerings, and stay connected.

On the site, you’ll find detailed profiles of our tutors, descriptions of the lessons available, and a straightforward booking system to make scheduling lessons simple and hassle-free. 

## **Value for prospective users**

The "Language Store" website is designed to serve both current students and those considering learning Spanish as a foreign language. Here's what the site offers:

    1. **For Current Students:**

        * A convenient way to contact the school or their tutor.
        * An easy-to-use booking system to schedule additional lessons.

    2. **For Prospective Students:**

        *Detailed information about available lessons, including the teaching approach and schedule.
        *Insight into the backgrounds of our experienced tutors, helping them make an informed decision about learning Spanish with our school.

Additionally, the "Find Classes" page provides:

    * A description of the school and its teaching philosophy.
    * An interactive calendar displaying the regular session dates for 2025.
    * The calendar is a standout feature, showcasing a thoughtful design implemented with CSS and dynamic functionality powered by JavaScript to ensure accurate alignment of days, months, and dates.

# **Project Goals**    

The development of the Language School website is driven by a practical goal: to create a user-friendly platform that enhances the learning experience for both students and tutors. As a developer of language lessons and materials, I envision this site as a central hub where students and tutors can easily connect and manage lessons with flexibility and convenience.

While the current version is in its initial stages, the vision for the website includes several exciting future enhancements:

* **Integrated Booking and Payment System:** Enable students to book and pay for lessons directly through the site, potentially using a PayPal API or a similar payment gateway.
User Accounts: Allow users to create personal accounts, where they can view, modify, or cancel bookings.
* **Tutor Accounts:** Provide tutors with secure login access to manage student communications and bookings.
* **Resource Database:** Develop a separate database of language-learning resources that students can purchase directly through the website.

This roadmap reflects the broader potential of the **Language School platform**, aiming to make language learning more accessible and seamless for everyone involved.

# First Stages, the planning phase

## **Homepage Design and Purpose**

The homepage is the "front door" of the Language School, designed to feel welcoming and attractive to new students. The goal is to inspire confidence and excitement in prospective learners by conveying that language learning can be accessible, enjoyable, and far removed from outdated, rigid methods.

# **Interactive Introduction: The Language Game**

To create an engaging first impression, the homepage features a playful language game inspired by the popular "Hangman" word game. However, in this version:

* **Game Focus:** The sentences have been replaced with simple, food-related Spanish words, ensuring that beginners are likely familiar with them.

* **Theme:** Instead of traditional visuals, this game features a snowman losing parts for incorrect guesses, adding a lighthearted and unique touch.

This interactive element reflects the school’s innovative and approachable teaching philosophy, emphasizing learning through fun and relatable methods.

## **Wireframes for the Homepage**

The following wireframes illustrate the planned layout and design of the homepage:

1. **Desktop Version:**
    The homepage includes an icon, title, and the interactive snowman-based hangman game.

2. **Mobile and Tablet Versions:**

    * On mobile devices, the central text is vertically aligned, narrowing the sides and growing vertically for improved readability.
    
    * On tablets, the layout mirrors the desktop view but is scaled to fit smaller screens.

## **Book a Class: Purpose and Functionality**

The **Book a Class** page allows prospective students to submit a booking for their chosen class. On this page, students can:

Once a student selects their desired class and time, they can click the Submit button. This will send their booking information to the school, who will then follow up with payment details. After submitting the form, the student will see a confirmation message explaining the next steps.

This streamlined booking process makes it easy for students to reserve a spot in their desired class while ensuring they receive all necessary information regarding payment.

# **Future Additions**

1. **Payment API Integration:**

To streamline the booking process, we plan to introduce a payment API, allowing students to pay directly through the website. This will eliminate the need for the office to follow up with payment details, making the process quicker and more convenient.

2. **Login Functionality:**

A login page will be added for both students and tutors, providing personalized access to booking information, lesson history, and communication features. This will help enhance the user experience by offering greater control and accessibility for all users.



ISSUES

An issue I encountered while building this project, is that although the calendar worked, when I was trying to use javascript for another part, the submit button of the contact form this did not work. The idea is that when clicking submit a thank you message would come up. When trying to build this functionality, it did not work. The message was that the button did not exist. I reached out to a tutor from the Code Institute, who suggested this was because there was a conflict in the javascript code, because it was all on one file. I took up her suggestion to create different files for the different javascript functionalities, and naming them to match the with the page they go with. This seemed to fix the issue. 

Another constant issue I've been having with any project on Gitpod is that quite often the commands to commit changes won't work. The only way to sort his is clearing cache and realoading, although sometimes I have to do this 2 or 3 times for it to work. This is a big issue as it interrups the flow, and sometimes I can't commit till the next day, with the danger of "forgetting" what all the changes were.

Melting Snowman: I decided to include a game on the site linked to Spanish learning, as a way to attract new students and to show that our classes are fun. I used https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-code-a-simple-game/ as a base for this game.

ISSUE AND CODE TESTING

FINDA A TUTOR PAGE
I added some information in the findatutor javascript file. Specifically, a new tutor and code for also the book a lesson page. However, then the form on the find a tutor page stopped working. It did not display the tutors details. I thought it was because of the added javascript code. However, even when removed it still did not work. After quering with online AI support, the answer was that I had missed a comma between two items of the tutor array. Once this sorted the page worked again.

BOOK A CLASS
When click to select a specific lesson, a message confirming the booking comes up. However, when clicking okay the page threw an error.

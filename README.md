## **What is this language school all about!**

The **"Language Store"** website is a hub for language enthusiasts, connecting passionate language teachers with students eager to learn. It serves two primary purposes:

1. **Promoting Services:** Showcasing the expertise of our tutors and the variety of lessons offered, attracting new students to join.
2. **Supporting Current Students:** Providing a seamless platform for existing students to book lessons, explore new offerings, and stay connected.

On the site, you’ll find detailed profiles of our tutors, descriptions of the lessons available, and a straightforward booking system to make scheduling lessons simple and hassle-free. 

## **Value for prospective users**

The "Language Store" website is designed to serve both current students and those considering learning Spanish as a foreign language. Here's what the site offers:

    1. **For Current Students:**

        * A convenient way to contact the school or their tutor.
        * An easy-to-use booking system to schedule additional lessons.

    2. **For Prospective Students:**

        *Detailed information about available lessons, including the teaching approach and schedule.
        *Insight into the backgrounds of our experienced tutors, helping them make an informed decision about learning Spanish with our school.

    * An interactive calendar displaying the regular session dates for 2025.
    * The calendar is a standout feature, showcasing a thoughtful design implemented with CSS and dynamic functionality powered by JavaScript to ensure accurate alignment of days, months, and dates.

# **Project Goals**    

The development of the Language School website is driven by a practical goal: to create a user-friendly platform that enhances the learning experience for both students and tutors. As a developer of language lessons and materials, I envision this site as a central hub where students and tutors can easily connect and manage lessons with flexibility and convenience.

While the current version is in its initial stages, the vision for the website includes several exciting future enhancements:

* **Integrated Booking and Payment System:** Enable students to book and pay for lessons directly through the site, potentially using a PayPal API or a similar payment gateway.
User Accounts: Allow users to create personal accounts, where they can view, modify, or cancel bookings.
* **Tutor Accounts:** Provide tutors with secure login access to manage student communications and bookings.
* **Resource Database:** Develop a separate database of language-learning resources that students can purchase directly through the website.

This roadmap reflects the broader potential of the **Language School platform**, aiming to make language learning more accessible and seamless for everyone involved.

# First Stages, the planning phase

## **Homepage Design and Purpose**

The homepage is the "front door" of the Language School, designed to feel welcoming and attractive to new students. The goal is to inspire confidence and excitement in prospective learners by conveying that language learning can be accessible, enjoyable, and far removed from outdated, rigid methods.

# **Interactive Introduction: The Language Game**

To create an engaging first impression, the homepage features a playful language game inspired by the popular "Hangman" word game. However, in this version:

* **Game Focus:** The sentences have been replaced with simple, food-related Spanish words, ensuring that beginners are likely familiar with them.

* **Theme:** Instead of traditional visuals, this game features a snowman losing parts for incorrect guesses, adding a lighthearted and unique touch.

This interactive element reflects the school’s innovative and approachable teaching philosophy, emphasizing learning through fun and relatable methods.

## **Wireframes for the Homepage**

The following wireframes illustrate the planned layout and design of the homepage:

1. **Desktop Version:**

# **Future Additions**

1. **Payment API Integration:**

To streamline the booking process, we plan to introduce a payment API, allowing students to pay directly through the website. This will eliminate the need for the office to follow up with payment details, making the process quicker and more convenient.

2. **Login Functionality:**

A login page will be added for both students and tutors, providing personalized access to booking information, lesson history, and communication features. This will help enhance the user experience by offering greater control and accessibility for all users.

## **Design Choices**

### **Minimalistic and Modern Layout**

The design of the **Language Store** project follows a minimalistic approach to ensure that the interface is clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate. The layout prioritizes the most important elements—such as the class schedules, tutor information, and contact forms—without overwhelming the user with unnecessary details. This design ensures that the content is easily accessible and maintains the focus on key functionalities.

### **Color Scheme**

The color scheme is **neutral and subtle**, with soft tones that contribute to a professional, yet welcoming atmosphere. The goal is to create a sense of calm and focus, allowing the content to stand out without distraction. Highlights and buttons use slightly bolder colors to draw attention to important actions, such as booking a class or contacting the team.

### **Typography**

The typography is chosen to be **clean and readable**, with a sans-serif font that offers modern aesthetics and optimal legibility. The font size and spacing are carefully balanced to ensure that the text is easy to read on all devices, whether on desktops, tablets, or mobile phones.

### **User-Centered Design**

The user experience (UX) is at the core of the project. The design ensures that users can quickly find the information they need—whether it’s about available tutors, lesson schedules, or contact details. Features such as the **calendar for booking lessons** and the **Find a Tutor page** have been carefully crafted to offer an intuitive and seamless experience, reducing friction and making interactions as straightforward as possible.

### **Mobile-Responsive Design**

The website is designed to be fully **responsive**, ensuring that it adapts seamlessly across all devices. On mobile phones, the layout adjusts to provide vertical text and intuitive navigation, while on tablets and desktops, it remains horizontal and more spacious. This approach guarantees a consistent experience for users, regardless of their device.

### **Visual Appeal and Functionality**

The use of **high-quality images** and **subtle animations** enhances the aesthetic appeal of the site, while maintaining the focus on usability. For example, the **Hangman game** on the homepage adds an engaging element for new users, providing an interactive and enjoyable introduction to the school. The Find Spanish Classes Online page is designed with a simple, accessible calendar that allows users to easily view and select their desired class schedule.

## **Challenges and Solutions**

During the development of this project, I encountered a few issues that required troubleshooting:

1. **Contact Form Submit Button Issue:**

Initially, when trying to implement JavaScript functionality for the contact form, I ran into a problem where the submit button was not working. The intended behavior was for a "Thank You" message to appear when the user clicked submit, but instead, I received an error stating that the button did not exist. After consulting with a tutor from the Code Institute, I learned that this issue was likely caused by a JavaScript conflict. Since all the JavaScript code was in one file, it was interfering with the form functionality.

Following the tutor’s advice, I separated the JavaScript code into different files, each corresponding to the specific page it was meant to function with. This approach resolved the issue and allowed the contact form to work as intended.

2. **Responsive Calendar Display:**

When checking the Find Classes page on different devices (https://lidiamorejudo.github.io/LanguageStoreProject2/time-table.html), I noticed that the calendar was not centered on smaller screens; it appeared aligned to the right. To fix this, I applied specific CSS styles to the calendar table, adjusting the padding to make it responsive to different screen sizes. I also made sure the font size adjusted accordingly, appearing smaller on smaller screens for better readability.

3. **Issue with Find a Tutor Page Form**

I added some new information to the findatutor.js file, including a new tutor and additional code for the Book a Lesson page. However, after making these changes, the form on the Find a Tutor page stopped working, and the tutor details were no longer displayed. Initially, I thought the issue was caused by the new JavaScript code I had added. Even after removing the added code, the problem persisted.

After seeking help from online AI support, I discovered that the issue was due to a missing comma between two items in the tutor array. Once I fixed this, the page functioned properly again, and the tutor details were displayed as expected.

4. **Issue with Book a Class button**
On the book a class page, I wanted to give the impression that this is a real booking page. Of course, in a project at this stage, there is no backend yet. So, when booking I wanted a message confirming the booking. However, I run into the issue that the message would not work. In the end, this was due to the form being set to "POST", while in fact, there is no backend, so the form was trying to post but there is nowhere to post. When I deleted this POST from method in the form, I was able to have a confirmation message.

## **Credits, Inspiration, and Sources Consulted**

**Melting Snowman Game:**

To make the website more engaging for prospective students and showcase the fun aspect of our language classes, I included a game related to Spanish learning. I used this tutorial from FreeCodeCamp as a foundation to create the Melting Snowman game.(https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-code-a-simple-game/)
